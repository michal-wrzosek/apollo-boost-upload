# Apollo Boost (Upload)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/apollo-boost-upload)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-boost-upload)

Basically ApolloBoost but with `apollo-upload-client` instead of `apollo-link-http`, so that you can upload files via Apollo.

It's almost an identical copy of 'apollo-boost':
[apollo-boost](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/master/packages/apollo-boost/src/index.ts) => [apollo-boost-upload](https://github.com/michal-wrzosek/apollo-boost-upload/blob/master/src/index.ts)

apollo-boost => apollo-boost-upload

v0.4.4 => v1.0.0

## Installation:
```
npm i apollo-boost-upload
```

## How to use:
Exactly like you would use [apollo-boost](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-boost).

## Development:
This package was bootstrapped with [typescript-lib-boilerplate](https://github.com/michal-wrzosek/typescript-lib-boilerplate)

```
npm run i
npm run dev
```
